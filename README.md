# difcScrape
web scraper for the dubai DIFC chamber of commerce website (Scapyd and Kafka)

## Why?
Wanted to publish one of my many scrapers using scrapyd should someone, someday be interested in scraping the DIFC website.

## Tech
This scraper was part of a larger system using kafka to shuttle data in realtime thorugh a processing and storage pipeline.

## Disclaimer
It has been quite a while since I have run this and websites change periodically so it may or may not work on the current DIFC website. If this is helpful in developing your own scraper and integrating it with Kafka I would love to hear from you!
